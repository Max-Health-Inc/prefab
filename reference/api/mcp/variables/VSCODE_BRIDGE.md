# Variable: VSCODE\_BRIDGE

```ts
const VSCODE_BRIDGE: Readonly<Record<string, VsCodeTokenSource>>;
```

Defined in: [mcp/theme-bridge.ts:36](https://github.com/Max-Health-Inc/prefab/blob/7a2e43417fa83301b42abd7447c199249e6c40f6/src/mcp/theme-bridge.ts#L36)

prefab tokens that VS Code can supply, with the same variables and static
fallbacks `prefab.css` uses. Tokens VS Code has no equivalent for (`--success`,
`--warning`, shadows, radii) are deliberately absent: the bridge only overrides
what the editor can actually provide.
